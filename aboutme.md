Hi, I'm Vladimir, a Data Science enthusiast.

I am very passionate about Data Science, Data Analysis, Deep Learning, AI - are most interesting for me, ironically are most boring for many others! I might dive very deep with my head into some DS project for a week or more to the point of day and night become indistinguishable, to come up later on with a sense of accomplishment and deep gratification. Yes, this is how it happens sometimes.

What else?
- I'm a vegetarian, sometimes rawtarian, and also into ecology a lot.
- Music is my saving grace, literally.
- oh yes, why "quicksilver"? Well, it is the coolest character in Marvel universe. Check out [the video](https://youtu.be/oynFdbNJ03M) with him saving Professor Xavier's gifted students.

### Data Science path
My Introduction started with a 5-course specialization at University of Michigan Applied Data Science with Python at [coursera.org](http://coursera.org)

As a great place for practice, connection and discussions with data-science folks all over the world is [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io)

And an outstanding 5-course Specialization on Deep Learning at [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai) by amazing Andrew Ng (yes, people call him that for the way he represents the material).

Thanks for visiting my blog!
